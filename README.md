# Huffman-Coding-for-text-Compression-Matlab
This report is focused on Compression and Decompression of a text file using any
of the source coding (Huffamn-coding), The MATLAB program presented here
encodes and decodes the information and also outputs the values of efficiency
and frequency probabilities of characters present in the data stream.

In this code, with little adjustment, will work for image and video compression.
